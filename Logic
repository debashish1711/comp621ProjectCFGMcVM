Obtain each node from the XMLtoAST.cpp
  For each node create a flowpoint
     Merge expression FlowPoint if part of same flow point, in single FLow point Ne
     Merge consecutive flow points, if not part of a loop into single Compound block
     
     In case of loops (Forstmt, Whilestmt or LoopStmt), flow points should be one after another. 
     Eg: for i=1:2:15     should have 1.ForStmt as the LoopStmt 2.Expression i=1 as the input 3.Condition i<=15 4.The body followed by i=i+2; Then there should be a backedge to the ForStmt
         {  body; }
    Same logic for WhileStmt

    In case of IfStmt there's a divergence into 2 different blocks. IfStmt(condition) -> isTrue -> ExecuteStmt or                        IfStmt(condition) -> isFalse -> Execute else part of the statement     Then merge the results of the ifStmt and the elseStmt.
2 edges from IfStmt, 1 for the case when the condition evaluated is true and the other for the case when the condition is false.

Call to function SNode

make this call from main in ConvertToMyAST.cpp
SNode* SyntaxNodeFactory::createNode(NodeData* n)



Then pass the argument for SNode
